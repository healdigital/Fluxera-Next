# License Renewal Alerts

Learn how to set up, manage, and respond to license expiration alerts to ensure uninterrupted service and maintain compliance.

## Overview

Fluxera's renewal alert system helps you stay ahead of license expirations by sending timely notifications. This ensures you have enough time to review, budget for, and process renewals before services are interrupted.

## How Renewal Alerts Work

The system automatically monitors all licenses with expiration dates and sends alerts based on configurable thresholds. Alerts are sent through multiple channels to ensure you never miss an important renewal.
